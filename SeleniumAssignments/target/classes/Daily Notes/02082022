Why we are creating Webdriver instance(WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();) instead of creating object for Chrome like ChromeDriver driverC = new ChromeDriver();
> Compactability
> some methods are available only for some drivers, which is not compactability in some other drivers,
> Eg: resetInputState(); which is available only for Chrome. When we tried to change driver to Firefox, code will show error.
> To avoid this we create instance for WebDriver

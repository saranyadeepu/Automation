Difference between get() and navigate() methods.

get()	
It is responsible for loading the page and waits until the page has finished loading.
It cannot track the history of the browser.

navigate()
It is only responsible for redirecting the page and then returning immediately.
It tracks the browser history and can perform back and forth in the browser.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between quit() and close() methods.
driver.close() 
- closes only the current window on which Selenium is running automated tests. 
The WebDriver session, however, remains active.

driver.quit() 
- closes all browser windows and ends the WebDriver session.

TO resolve this issue: 
> no need to maintain Driver folder(can delete)
> Need to add dependency
